# AzureML-CreditScoreSolution
Credit Score Prediction Web Application 🌟
This project is a fully functional Credit Score Prediction Web Application powered by Machine Learning and hosted using Flask. It is designed to predict an individual's creditworthiness based on key financial and demographic factors.

🌟 Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive form for data input, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Real-Time Predictions: Utilizes Azure ML's powerful inference endpoint for fast and accurate credit score predictions.

Customizable Framework: Built with Flask, making it easy to extend and deploy.

Industry-Relevant: Demonstrates practical integration of machine learning into real-world use cases for financial institutions.

💡 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2 templates.

Backend: Python, Flask, REST API.

Machine Learning: Azure ML endpoint for robust model serving.

Deployment Ready: Locally hosted with Flask for demonstration; can be easily extended to production environments.

🚀 Quick Start Guide
Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository_url>  
cd credit-score-model 

Install Dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  

Set Up Environment Variables:
Replace <api_key> in app.py with your Azure ML API key.
Alternatively, store the key in an environment variable for better security.

Run the Application:
python app.py  

Access the Application:
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000  

🎯 How It Works
Input Details: Enter financial and demographic details (e.g., age, income, credit history[Payment, Total Amount repayed]) in the form.

Submit the Form: The data is securely sent to an Azure ML inference endpoint via API calls.

Receive Predictions: The model processes the input and predicts the credit score in real time.

View Results: The predicted credit score is displayed on the same page.
